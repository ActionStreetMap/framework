Mercraft is engine for building real city/environment from OSM data.

The main goal is simulate real city which includes:
	* rendering of different models like buildings, roads, parks, rivers, etc. using OSM data for given location
	* fill environment by people, cars, animals with realistic behavior
	* add character to the scene which is capable to interact with this environment
	* game world should be limited only by OSM maps which means that game world is almost entire Earth
	* using some external services to extend environment (for example, weather, famous places, events, etc.)

It should be possible to build different 3D-games (either car simulations or GTA like games) on top this engine for mobile devices.
