ActionStreetMap (ASM) is engine for building real city environment dynamically using OSM data.

The main goal is simulate real city which includes:
	* rendering of different models like buildings, roads, parks, rivers, etc. using OSM data for given location using terrain tiling approach (DONE partially)
	* render non-flat world by using Data Elevation Model (DEM) files (DONE partially)
	* add character to the scene which is capable to interact with this environment (DONE partially)
	* fill environment by people, cars, animals with realistic behaviour (Not started)
	* using some external services to extend environment (for example, weather, famous places, events, public transport schedule, etc.) (Not started)
	* Multiplayer (Not started)

It should be possible to build different 3D-games (either car simulations or GTA 2/3 like games) or some helpers on top this framework especially for mobile devices. Actually, game world should be limited only by OSM maps which means that game world is almost entire Earth
		
Development

	Technologies: Unity3D, C# (JavaScript is possible for Unity scripting)
	
Vocabulary:
	General:
		* OSM - OpenStreetMap which provides open map data
		* Pbf - binary file format for storing OSM data
			Download links for different areas (or for entire planet) can be found here: http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Planet.osm
		* Splitter - tool for splitting OSM files to smaller ones. Besides ASM framework supports regular pbf files, splitting with created index file allows to increase performance in orders of magnitude. It makes preprocessing of downloaded pbf files as must have.
			NOTE: this tool is committed to project repository: Tools\Splitter. Please read the corresponding README file. Actually, all you need is to run bat file with arguments.
			Newest version of original tool can be downloaded here: http://www.mkgmap.org.uk/download/splitter.html	
		* SRTM - DEM files which contain elevation information for given geo coordinate. 
			Can be downloaded for free: http://dds.cr.usgs.gov/srtm/version2_1/SRTM3/
		* Way/Node/Relation - OSM primitives (http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Elements)
		* Bounding box (bbox) - something like http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_bounding_box

	Application specific:
		* ActionStreetMap - project name. "StreetMap" is related to OpenStreetMap project, "Action" means that you can interact with map objects.
		* Tile - terrain square of certain size which contains loaded game objects (buildings, roads, etc). You can see tile object and its children in editor once it is generated.
		* MapCSS - a CSS-like language for map stylesheets (http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/MapCSS. It allows to use declarative approach to process OSM tags instead of processing them in code.
			NOTE: App implementation uses custom syntax in some places, but the general idea is the same.
			
		* DebugConsole - debugger console which is available in game. Provides the way to see log messages 
			and perform custom commands like get information about current loaded zone/tile, etc.
			NOTE: under development

HOW TO
	* Use map of different places
		1. Download pbf file of desired place from any source (e.g. http://download.geofabrik.de/)
		2. Split it using splitter tool. This tool splits big osm file to smaller ones and creates index file which helps to increase performance.
			NOTE: this tool is committed to project repository: Tools\Splitter. Please read the corresponding README file. Actually, all you need is to run bat file with arguments.
			Newest version of original tool can be downloaded here: http://www.mkgmap.org.uk/download/splitter.html	
		3. Download elevation data file (SRTM) of given area from http://dds.cr.usgs.gov/srtm/version2_1/SRTM3/ . Unpack it.
		4. Modify Assets\Resources\Config\settings.json config:
			* "mapdata" should be set to folder which contains split result of pbf file.
			* "elevationdata" should be set to folder which contains downloaded SRTM files with .hgt extension
			* "position" should be set to geo coordinate of desired place

FAQ
	* I got exception like "Exception: SRTM data cell not found: Maps/elevation\N52E013.hgt"
		Reason: application cannot find elevation data file of given area.
		Fix: Download N52E013 (use filename from your error message!) from http://dds.cr.usgs.gov/srtm/version2_1/SRTM3/ . Then ensure that "elevationdata" is set to folder which contains that file.
	* I got exception like "FileNotFoundException: Could not find file "<...>\Demo\Assets\Resources\Maps\osm\berlin\00000013.osm.pbf""
		Reason: areas.list is an index file and it represents a result of splitting pbf file. So, it contains record for given area and this record says that 00000013.osm.pbf contains data
		for it. However, this file cannot be found
		Fix: Check whether all files which are described in areas.list present on disk.
	* I got empty terrain
		Reason: No areas.list were found.
		Fix: Follow "Use map of different places" section from HOW TO
	* Strange buildings, terrain...
		Reason: bugs in ASM framework or mapCSS rules
		Fix: Check bug list and report bug if it's something new. Please provides steps how to reproduce.

Known issues:
	* No processing of multipolygon inner ways. 
	* Issues with multipolygon processing: no parts of buildings. Example: 55.75406,37.62116 (Moscow, Red square)
	* Wrong elevation smooth processing
	* Cross tile elevation issues with buildings
	* Overlapping roads
	* Trees/grass on roads
	* No sea rendering
	* Not all roof types are supported
	* UV mapping of roof is wrong
	...

Backlog:
	Top priority:
		* Multipolygon improvement
		* Improve road processing by road network creation and improve their rendering
		* Decrease tile loading time
	
	Core features:
		* Add cars, people, etc. (requires AI and logic for putting these objects into world)
		
	Nice to have:
		* Visualize zone loading process
		* improve/refactor DebugConsole: console should support various commands (e.g. statistic, osm specific debug info)

Software architecture
	TODO
	
Development Tips:
	Do not use Singleton pattern
	Do not use DI as Service Locator
	Follow GRASP and SOLID principles
	Use TDD approach
